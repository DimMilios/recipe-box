      'Once your chicken is cooked pour your freshly squeezed orange juice into your pan, then pour in some soy sauce (you want your orange juice to soy sauce ratio to be about 3:1, use your best judgment on how much to pour in). Add honey (use as much as you want, I wouldn’t use less than two tablespoons though) and stir. Turn the stove to medium-high.',
